## Project 4 

In this project we had to create a quiz app, this was quite the challenge. there were many things to keep in mind. Frist I started with the HTML doc, I placed all the nessary elements and organized the doc. Once that was done moved on to linking the CSS, and adding some styles to the page. Next step was addind the javascript at the end of the HTML doc, I then moved on to working in the javascript. I started with the question bank making that an array so that I could index though all the questions. Then I moved on to calling the HTML elements to the javascript so i can use them in my functions. After this was done I started to try to bulid my functions.
